    <h1>Nagi Seishiro</h1>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bluelock/images/6/65/Seishiro_Nagi_uniform_anime_design.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/119?cb=20220722111907" alt="Nagi">
    <h2>Nagi is an unnaturally talented soccer player with amazing reflexes, good speed, and jumping skills. However, he is a very lazy and unmotivated person. As long as he can get a good job and keep living a lax life, he is fine with doing anything. He initially does not want to put in any effort into football and belittles those who are weak and talentless at the game. He does not even know much about the best football players in the world, much to the chagrin of his competitors. Initially, he is shown as indifferent to playing soccer and becoming the best striker, and would rather play video games or skip training.</h2>

    <h1>Isagi Yoichi</h1>

    <h2>Isagi is easygoing and has a generally friendly, cheery personality, but his simple and innocent habits often get on the nerves of the people around him. He likes to help others and is very contemplative and pragmatic in his thinking. He tends to avoid any childish squabbles among other Blue Lock competitors and tries to be a peacekeeper between his friends and rivals. At the beginning of Blue Lock, Isagi is massively unsure of himself and his skill due to being the second lowest ranked player in Blue Lock initially and his conflicting ideas of football. As time goes on, Isagi develops a more assertive presence on and off the field, becoming the foundation for Team Z and garnering the respect of some of the best players in Blue Lock who mostly have heavily assertive or dominant personalities. As of Third Selection, Isagi has the confidence, charisma, and reputation to talk openly with Rin Itoshi, one of the most talented yet difficult people in the Blue Lock Project.</h2>

    <h1>Barou Shoei</h1>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bluelock/images/1/11/Shoei_Baro_uniform_anime_design.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/129?cb=20220610113029" alt="Barou">
    <h2>In accordance with his perception of himself as "the King", Baro has an imperious personality, seeing himself above others maintaining an arrogant and selfish attitude. Initially, Baro perceived all others on the field as supporting roles, moving for the sake of his own goals, with himself being the main actor on the stage. He is obsessed with pursuing his own soccer but doesn't actually like it or have a passion for it. Baro is motivated by the need to face others who play soccer and to use his goals to drag them off the seat of the main actor and replace them. The pleasure obtained through this is something Baro believes is only for the strong. Baro is the kind of player who refuses to pass the ball and whenever he loses possession, he endeavors to steal the ball back or steal a goal.</h2>
